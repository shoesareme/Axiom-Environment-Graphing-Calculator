# Axiom-Environment-Graphing-Calculator
The Axiom Environment Graphing Calculator is a graphing calculator meant to explore mathematical systems with different axioms. It will eventually include graphing for numbers, complex numbers, and more.


## Currently working on: 

- ### Normal Graphing Calculator
- Fixing Continuity Bug [MOSTLY DONE]
- Speeding up method 3
- Method 4 (Method 2 version of method 3)
- Inverse Method ??? (method 5) (x^2 -> sqrt(x))
- pConstant customization (parameter for class or derived from calculation or both)
- Class parameter customization and general parameter customization [Backlog]
- Comments [never]
- ### Environments and Environment Graphing Calculator (mod of normal cal)
- Develop Normal Math Enviroment (Int and Float)
- Complex Environment
- Modular Environment
- Integrating enviroments with code
- Get rid of EXEC (maybe or move it elsewhere)
- ### Other
- Documentation
- Wiki??
- How To Use
- Readme
- File Formating
- Ideas
- My lack of motivation for this project and all other projects [On Hold]
