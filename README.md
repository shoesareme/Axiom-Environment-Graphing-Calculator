# Axiom-Environment-Graphing-Calculator
The Axiom Environment Graphing Calculator is a graphing calculator meant to explore mathematical systems with different axioms. It will eventually include graphing for numbers, complex numbers, and more.


## Currently working on: 

- ### Normal Graphing Calculator
- Method 4 (Method 2 version of method 3) [PRIORITY]
- Inverse Method ??? (method 5) (x^2 -> sqrt(x)) [Backlog]
- pConstant customization (parameter for class or derived from calculation or both) [Backlog]
- Safety features
- Method 2/4 bug [PRIORITY]
- Integration with customMath.py [Backlog]
- Class parameter customization and general parameter customization [Backlog]
- Comments [not possible]
- ### Environments and Environment Graphing Calculator (mod of normal cal)
- Develop Normal Math Enviroment (Int and Float)
- Complex Environment [never]
- Modular Environment [never]
- Integrating enviroments with code
- Other systems [never]
- Get rid of EXEC (maybe or move it elsewhere)
- ### Other
- Documentation
- Wiki (yes)
- How To Use
- Readme
- File Formating
- Ideas
- My lack of motivation for this project and all other projects [On Hold]4
- Lack of motivation for this project is gonna end it soon.
